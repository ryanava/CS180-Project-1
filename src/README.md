Hello!

I have allowed users to choose:
1. which image they want to align (write as: name.tif or name.jpg)
2. how large of an area they want to search for displacements (at the top of the pyramid)
3. what naive search they want to use (i used ncc, but you can input either ncc or euclidean)
4. finally whether you want to naively align the image or use the image pyramid (type in naive or pyramid)

this should run pretty quickly on anything. if it takes longer than 10-15 seconds on naive or pyramid, you may have typed in something wrong

hopefully the comments are informative and the code is easy to understand. safe travels :)
